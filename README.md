# Advent of code skeleton


Either set your `AOC_SESSION_COOKIE` env variable or add it into the make command as an argument like so:
```bash
make input DAY=5 AOC_SESSION_COOKIE=your_cookie
```
which will download your puzzle input into `./inputs/day05/Q_input.txt`

To run all the tests:

```bash
make test
```

Add new folders files for the following days as you progress.
